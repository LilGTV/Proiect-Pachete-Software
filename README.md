# Uber Rides Data Analysis with Python & SAS

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data using both Python with Streamlit and SAS, combining modern interactive tools with robust statistical processing.

In the **Python** part, we built a Streamlit application that provides an interactive way to explore and visualize the dataset. The app includes advanced functionalities such as geospatial analysis with GeoPandas, handling missing values and outliers, encoding and scaling data, as well as statistical preprocessing, grouping, and aggregation with Pandas. We also implemented machine learning methods using scikit-learn, including clustering and logistic regression, and applied multiple regression modeling with the statsmodels library. Together, these features allow for both exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling within an intuitive web interface.

In parallel, we carried out extensive data processing and analysis in **SAS**. We created datasets from external files, applied user-defined formats, and used iterative and conditional processing to prepare the data. The work also included creating subsets, applying SAS functions, and combining datasets through SAS procedures and SQL. Arrays and reporting procedures were used to streamline workflows, while statistical and machine learning techniques available in SAS ML and SAS Viya supported more advanced analysis. Finally, we generated graphical reports to summarize the findings in a clear and accessible way.

By combining the strengths of both Python and SAS, we demonstrated how interactive visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling can be integrated into a complete framework for analyzing large transportation datasets.
